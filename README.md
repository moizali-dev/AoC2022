# AoC2022

This repo contains the code for the solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022/) in `Python` and the learnings from each day

## Learnings 

Day1: Calculating max of a `list`  

Day2: `Dictionaries`  

Day3: `Sets` and `intersection`    

Day4: String `split`  

Day5: `List of lists`  

Day6: `Loops`  

Day7: Creating a `Tree Data Structure`; Using OOP and applying `inheretance`; Solving using `recursion`  

Day8: Breaking the puzzle into sections using functions like `isBorderElement` and `isTreeVisible`  

Day9: `2D Arrays` (creating a `Board Object`);  Using OOP (applying `getter` and `setter` methods) and applying `inheretance`; using `unitVector` methodology to figure out if two points are diagonal or not and their direction  

Day10: Parsing text with `iteration` thats not aligned with new line

Day11: Using OOP to create a monkey `object`; using LCM and modulus arithmetic to solve part 2 ([link](https://aoc.just2good.co.uk/2022/11))
